        <h1>Intro to the Rubik's Cube</h1>
        <div class="rintro"><h2 style="color:deepskyblue">
            The Rubik's cube is cubical in shape. It has six faces with the colours red,yellow,green,blue,orange and white.
            Yellow and white, green and blue and red and orange are opposite each other.
            The cube has 3 layers. The first layer, the middle layer and the last layer.
            The cube has a total of 26 pieces. It has three main types of pieces that are Centers, Corners and Edges.

        <h2 style="color:lime">
            
            There are six center pieces. They are located on each face of the cube. The centers hold the cube together.
            They make up most of the core. The core is what holds the Rubik's cube from falling apart.

        <div class="corner">
        <h2 style="color:red">
            There are 8 corners. They each have 3 stickers on them.

    </div>
    <div class="edges">
        <h2 style="color: deepskyblue">
            There are 12 edges. They have 2 stickers on them. The middle layer is the only layer which only has edges and centers and no corners.

        To perform moves on the Rubik's cube you need to understand <b>Notation.</b>
        There are 12 main moves in Notation but to learn how to solve the Rubik's cube with the beginner method you only need to know 8.
        They are right, left, forward and up.
    </h2>
    <h2>That covers the basics of the Rubik's cube though I won't teach you how to read or perform moves using notation.</h2>
